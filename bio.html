		<h1> Liat Litwin </h1>

		<div id="biotext"> I am a senior majoring in Cognitive and Brain Science at Tufts University. I grew up in Berkeley, California in an Israeli family. Before college, I spent a year in Israel travelling, studying, and volunteering. At Tufts, I am involved in Tufts Against Genocide, promoting awareness and activism on campus by bringing various speakers and events to the community. I also do research in Rob Jacob's Brain Computer Interaction Lab, investigating how Google Glass can adapt to physiological brain data. <br><br>
		I'm excited to be in Web Programming this semester, expanding on the (minimial) skills I had as a middle schooler designing websites for my neopets.
