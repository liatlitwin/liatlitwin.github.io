						For my senior project, I conducted research in the <strong><a href = "http://hci.cs.tufts.edu/"> Human Computer Interaction Lab at Tufts University. </a></strong> I specialized in brain computer interfacing using <strong> Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) </strong>, a non-invasive measure of blood oxygenation levels in the frontal lobe of the brain. We integrated <strong> Google Glass </strong>, a wearable computer with an optical display, and prototyped an application which utilizes fNIRS-data to make intelligent adaptations in the Glass interface. <br>
						Over the course of the year, I was responsible for programming the front-end application created with <strong> Unity3D.</strong> I also spear-headed the pilot testing once we had the Glass device integrated with the Unity application. This is still a work in progress, and the PhD students at the HCI lab at Tufts are continuing to move forward with this exciting research. I presented the poster below at the year-end Cognitive and Brain Science colloquium with students and faculty present. <br><br>
