						This website was created as an application to calculate and minimze the number of money transfers by consolidating debts within a network of people. Users are able to input new transactions, and then visualize the consolidated money transfers with a "web" graphic. 
						<br><br>
						I created this website as part of the group project for a Web Programming class at Tufts. My primary responsibility was in organizing the layou of the website and working on the front-end component. As each team-member finished their part, I put everything together to make it a working application. We utilized <strong> Bootstrap, AngularJS, HTML5/CSS, MongoDB, Javascript, and Jquery.</strong><br>
						The images below are wireframes I created before building the web application.
						The final web application prototype is available <strong><a href = http://ioyou-app.herokuapp.com/> here </a></strong>, as well as the  Github  page<strong><a href = https://github.com/liatlitwin/comp20-s2014-team12> here</a></strong>. To log in to the web app, you may use the credentials 'user' and password '123'.
